# Time-Series-Analysis

## Background

The financial departments of large companies often deal with foreign currency transactions while doing international business. As a result, they are always looking for anything that can help them better understand the future direction and risk of various currencies. Hedge funds, too, are keenly interested in anything that will give them a consistent edge in predicting currency movements.

In this assignment, you will test the many time-series tools that you have learned in order to predict future movements in the value of the Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar.

You will gain proficiency in the following tasks:

1. Time Series Forecasting
2. Linear Regression Modeling

## Conclusion

#### Based on your time series analysis, would you buy the yen now? Is the risk of the yen expected to increase or decrease? Based on the model evaluation, would you feel confident in using these models for trading?
   According to the Time series analysis the ARMA model shows that the Rate of return of investing in the yen would be positive. Furthermore the Plot forcasting the settle price shows that the price of the yen futures contract will also increase. The Garch model shows us that volatility of the yen will also increase over the next five days signifiying higher risk. Whether you should invest in the yen now is relative to what other assets you could invest in now and how do their returns and risk compare to the yen. To conclude if you invest in the Yen right now you will make money in the short term however you will also take on increased risk. 

#### Does this model perform better or worse on out-of-sample data compared to in-sample data?
   Based on the Results of the RMSE I can conclude that the model performs worse on out of sample data compared to in sample (training) data. This is evident in the higher RMSE (0.596 > 0.415). RMSE is typically higher for out of sample data so this result is not suprising however in this case the RMSE is about 43% higher in out of sample data.
